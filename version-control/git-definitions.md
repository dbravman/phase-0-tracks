# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows a coder to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in code.
Version control is useful by allowing different coders to contribute to the same project.  It also is useful for when something goes wrong on a project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a project that can be worked on.
A branch can be used to create a specific independent feature without disrupting the entire code base. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point for a project.
A good commit message is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit.
* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two different branches have committed different revisions to the same file.
