-encrypt system (maybe with .next) so it will advance every letter one letter 
forward. lowercase/uppercase make no difference
    #.next while/until loop ; also 
    #    (1st attempt - .next)
    #    password.next make equal to variable name so can be called
    #    abc_string.index[whatever is next in index]

        #encrption = password + abc_string

        step 1: password[0].next = pass_var
        step 2: while the password.index is <= password.length, puts pass_var, end
            unable to delete so (step 3:) pass_var += encrpyt_pass = answer

-decrypt reverses .next, no .reverse, use index to go backward one letter.
    "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" = key

    step 1: password[-1]
        key.index(whatever the first letter is)

    step 2: abc_string.index[whatever is next in index = abc_decrypt, 
    step 3: answer = abc_decrypt +=
