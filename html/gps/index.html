<!-- Release 4:
The semantic tags provide meaning to the content.  Tags that can be defined by specific attributes, such as form and img, seem the most useful.  The browser will display elements in the order they are given in the html file, unless there is some instruction ie via CSS for positionings.
I learned how customizable Sublime is, and that google can help when using Sublime just as much as with anything else.  Working with sublime snippets was the most difficult part of the assignment, because I hadn't done anything like that before.  But now that it isn't unfamiliar, I can practice (and google) it to have better understanding. -->
